# Quiz-Game

This app is a lightweight quiz game that challenges the users to answer a variety of legal questions. 

The questions are varied in difficulty but are written for someone with a legal background; so don't get intimidated. 

## Functionality 

The quiz is generated by taking a random index of an array that contains objects for each question. The user picks their answer by clicking on the appropriate radio button and then hitting 'submit'. 

Currently the high-score and timer elements are not working fully and will be fixed in a later update.
